#NeoGAF 3D Screenshot Extension

## Goal
This is a chrome extension that should recognize the URLs of 3D screenshots and take the steps to embed them in your browser for inline viewing.  At the moment, it's geared toward use at http://www.neogaf.com, because that's where I was asked to create the extension for, but it should be adaptable to any site, really.
