#NeoGAF 3D Screenshot Extension

## Goal
This is a chrome extension that should recognize the URLs of 3D screenshots and take the steps to embed them in your browser for inline viewing.  At the moment, it's geared toward use at http://www.neogaf.com, because that's where I was asked to create the extension for, but it should be adaptable to any site, really.

## NOTE
This extension is not quite ready for use, as I just wanted to get the repo set up and everything working on my development environment.  I will make a note in the readme when it has been tested and ready to be tried out by regular users.
